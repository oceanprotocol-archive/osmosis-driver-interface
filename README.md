## How this works
This driver interface allows a data service provider such as [provider-py](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider-py) 
to work with any cloud backend such as Azure, AWS by using a driver that implements the `osmosis` interface. 

The `osmosis` interface is defined in `data_plugin.py` and `computing_plugin.py`. 
After writing a new driver, add a mapping in `driver_map.json` to allow `osmosis` to identify urls that the 
new driver is suitable to work with. 
The `driver_map` must be defined in the environment variable `OSMOSIS_DRIVER_MAP` using one of these methods:
* export OSMOSIS_DRIVER_MAP="/path/to/driver_map.json"
* export OSMOSIS_DRIVER_MAP='{"core.windows.net": "azure", "ipfs://": "ipfs", "NewProtocol://": "driver-module-name"}'

Load a driver:
* Create Osmosis instance by giving a `url` and `config_file_path` (optional). Note that 
config file is loaded from env var `CONFIG_PATH` if defined and takes precedence over `config_file_path`
* If a config file is used and has a value for the `module.path` option, then 
this path is used to load the osmosis driver regardless of the `url`
* If no `module.path` is defined, the driver module is automatically determined from 
the `url` using the `driver_map` as described above
  * The driver module name should follow the convention of `osmosis_<module-name>_driver`

  
## Code style

The information about code style in python is documented in these two links [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).
    
## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using {major|minor|patch} as first argument to bump the version accordingly.
