## Code style

The information about code style in python is documented in these two links [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).
    
## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using {major|minor|patch} as first argument to bump the version accordingly.
